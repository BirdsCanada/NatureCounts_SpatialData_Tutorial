# Chapter 4: Digital Elevation Data

##### Authors: Dimitrios Markou, Danielle Ethier

> In [Chapter 3](03-ClimateData.Rmd), you processed vector and raster climate data, combined them with NatureCounts observations, and visualized them using plots and spatiotemporal maps. In this tutorial, you will process **LiDAR**-derived Digital Terrain Models, apply cropping and masking procedures, and extract elevation values to combine with NatureCounts data. Your focus will be on the NatureCounts and spatial data within [La Mauricie National Park](https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/qc/mauricie/nature).

La Mauricie National Park is situated in the Laurentian mountains and covers 536 km2 within the Eastern Canadian Temperate-Boreal Forest transition ecoregion. The environment is characterized by mixed forests, lakes, rivers, and hills that range from from 150 m to over 500 m in elevation. The park provides suitable habitat for a variety of wildlife including at least 215 bird species.

Light Detection and Ranging (**LiDAR**) is an active remote sensing technology. It is performed using laser scanners that emit pulses of light and determine the position of target 3D objects by measuring the amount of time between pulses being emitted and received. It is a revolutionary technology that helps in the acquisition of extremely accurate digital elevation data over wide spatial and temporal scales. For more info and examples of LiDAR data resources specific to your province, see [LiDAR Data Resources](#4.5LiDAR) at the end of this Chapter.

# 4.0 Learning Objectives {#4.0LearningObjectives}

```

This tutorial uses the following spatial data.

1.  [Places administered by Parks Canada](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/e1f0c975-f40c-4313-9be2-beb951e35f4e/resource/0744186a-449b-4f1f-9f1e-952a94c6d5ca) - Boundary shapefiles

2.  [Quebec Breeding Bird Atlas (2010 - 2014)](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/datasets.jsp?code=QCATLAS2PC&sec=bmdr) - NatureCounts bird observations

3.  [Forêt ouverte (lidar-derived products)](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/fr/dataset/produits-derives-de-base-du-lidar) - Digital Terrain Models (DTMs)

# 4.1 Data Setup {#4.1DataSetup}

To read the National Park polygons into R, navigate to [Places administered by Parks Canada](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/e1f0c975-f40c-4313-9be2-beb951e35f4e/resource/0744186a-449b-4f1f-9f1e-952a94c6d5ca), click "Go to Resource" to download. Then extract the file to your directory before applying the `st_read()` function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# if the layers are in your working directory
national_parks <- st_read("vw_Places_Public_lieux_public_APCA.shp")

# else, specify the directory
national_parks <- st_read("path/to/your/shp")
```

Filter the **national_parks** dataset for La Mauricie National Park.

```{r}
View(national_parks) # to find the correct object ID

mauricie_boundary <- national_parks %>%
  filter(OBJECTID == "21")

# Drop the Z-dimension (3D component) to make it 2D
mauricie_boundary <- st_zm(mauricie_boundary, drop = TRUE, what = "ZM")
```

OPTIONAL: To save the boundary as a shapefile to your working directory, use the `st_write()` function. **The boundary files are used again in subsequent chapters**. We have uploaded them to the [**Google Drive data folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gLUC6fROl4kNBvTGselhZif-arPexZbY?usp=sharing) for your convenience.

> To execute this code chunk, remove the \#

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# st_write(mauricie_boundary, "mauricie_boundary.shp")

# st_write(mauricie_boundary, "mauricie_boundary.kml", driver="KML")
```

To assess the species distribution within the National Park, download data from the [Quebec Breeding Bird Atlas (2010 - 2014)](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/datasets.jsp?code=QCATLAS2PC&sec=bmdr) which is a 5 year census that collects data on the distribution and abundance of all species breeding in the province.

Don't forget to replace `testuser` with your NatureCounts username. You will be prompted for your password.

Download NatureCounts data:

```{r}
quebec_atlas <- nc_data_dl(collections = "QCATLAS2PC", username = "testuser", info = "spatial_data_tutorial", timeout = 500)
```

Read in the list of species names from NatureCounts which can be linked to the species id:

```{r}
species_names <- search_species()
```

To create date and doy columns and ensure that the ObservationCount column is in the correct numeric format we can apply the `format_dates()` and `mutate()` functions. We will also filter the dataset to exclude rows with missing coordinates.

```{r}
quebec_atlas <- quebec_atlas %>%
  format_dates() %>%  # create the date and doy columns 
  mutate(ObservationCount = as.numeric(ObservationCount)) %>%  # convert to numeric format
  filter(!is.na(longitude) & !is.na(latitude))  # remove rows with missing coordinates
```

To convert the NatureCounts data to a spatial object and transform its coordinate reference system (crs) to match the National Park boundary we can use the `st_as_sf()` and `st_transform()` functions, respectively.

```{r}
quebec_atlas_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(quebec_atlas,
                        coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326) # converts the quebec_atlas data to an sf object, crs = 4326 is WGS84 which corresponds to the NatureCounts data

mauricie_boundary <- st_transform(mauricie_boundary, crs = st_crs(quebec_atlas_sf)) # match the CRS between the polygon and point data
```

Clip the NatureCounts point data to the National Park boundary using `st_intersection()`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
mauricie_birds_sf <- sf::st_intersection(quebec_atlas_sf, mauricie_boundary)
```

Append the species names to the clipped NatureCounts dataset based on `species_id` code.

```{r}
mauricie_birds_sf <- mauricie_birds_sf %>%
  left_join(species_names, by = "species_id")
```

Tidyverse functions can help us summarize our data in a variety of ways. For example, we can determine the annual total count of birds for each year across all sites. To do this we use the `group_by()` function to group the observations by year, and `summarise()` to calculate and create the **annual_count** column.

```{r}
mauricie_birds_summary <- mauricie_birds_sf %>%
  group_by(survey_year) %>%
  summarise(annual_count = sum(ObservationCount, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% # calculates the annual_count
  filter(!is.na(survey_year))  # remove rows with missing year

mauricie_birds_summary
```

If you wanted to summarize total count for each species at each Atlas Block you could adjust the pipe using `pivot_wider()`.

```{r}
mauricie_species_summary <- mauricie_birds_sf %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%  # drop the geometry column
  group_by(english_name, Locality) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(ObservationCount, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% # calculates the total_count column
  pivot_wider(names_from = english_name, # populates the column names with each species common name
              values_from = total_count, # populates each cell with total_count
              values_fill = list(total_count = 0)) # missing values are zero-filled
 
View(mauricie_species_summary)
```

Drop the geometry column and convert the filtered NatureCounts data back to a regular dataframe. Select key attributes to reduce the dataframe.

```{r}
mauricie_birds_df <- mauricie_birds_sf %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%  # Drops the geometry column
  bind_cols(
    st_coordinates(mauricie_birds_sf) %>%  # Extract coordinates
      as.data.frame()  # Convert the coordinates to a data.frame
  ) %>%
  rename(longitude = X, latitude = Y)

mauricie_birds_df <- mauricie_birds_df %>% dplyr::select(record_id, species_id, english_name, SiteCode, survey_year, survey_month, survey_day, ObservationCount, longitude, latitude) # reduce the dataframe to the columns needed for your analysis
```

OPTIONAL: To save the NatureCounts data as a *.csv* to your disk, use the `write.csv()` function, specify the name of your .csv file, and use the row.names = FALSE argument to exclude row numbers from the output. **The filtered NatureCounts dataset will be used again in subsequent chapters**. We have uploaded this file to the [**Google Drive data folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gLUC6fROl4kNBvTGselhZif-arPexZbY?usp=sharing) for your convenience.

```{r}
# write.csv(mauricie_birds_df, "mauricie_birds_df.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

# 4.2 Elevation Models {#4.2ElevationModels}

Digital elevation datasets store topographic information like elevation or slope and are often used in landscape ecology. These datasets, i.e., Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), Digital Surface Models (DSMs), and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) are derived through a variety of remote sensing and spatial interpolation techniques and all help describe land features.

**Digital Elevation Model** - represents the bare-Earth surface and [excludes]{.underline} all terrain vector features (i.e., streams, breaklines, and ridges), and all ground objects (power lines, buildings, trees, and vegetation).

**Digital Surface Model** - represents the heights of the Earth's surface and [includes]{.underline} all natural and artificial features or ground objects.

**Digital Terrain Model** - represents the bare-Earth surface topography and includes all terrain vector features. It does not include natural or artificial ground objects. In other words, it is a DEM that is augmented by the presence of streams, breaklines, and ridges.

For quick-access to the elevation data, download the .tif files from their URL using the hyperlinks below. If you wish to gain experience in how-to access LiDAR data yourself, follow the steps [at the end of this Chapter](#4.6LiDAR).

**Click the following hyperlinks to download the LiDAR-derived elevation data for tiles [31I14NE](https://diffusion.mffp.gouv.qc.ca/Diffusion/DonneeGratuite/Foret/IMAGERIE/Produits_derives_LiDAR/31I/31I14NE/MNT_31I14NE.tif), [31I15NO](https://diffusion.mffp.gouv.qc.ca/Diffusion/DonneeGratuite/Foret/IMAGERIE/Produits_derives_LiDAR/31I/31I15NO/MNT_31I15NO.tif), [31I14SE](https://diffusion.mffp.gouv.qc.ca/Diffusion/DonneeGratuite/Foret/IMAGERIE/Produits_derives_LiDAR/31I/31I14SE/MNT_31I14SE.tif), [31I15SO](https://diffusion.mffp.gouv.qc.ca/Diffusion/DonneeGratuite/Foret/IMAGERIE/Produits_derives_LiDAR/31I/31I15SO/MNT_31I15SO.tif), [31I11NE](https://diffusion.mffp.gouv.qc.ca/Diffusion/DonneeGratuite/Foret/IMAGERIE/Produits_derives_LiDAR/31I/31I11NE/MNT_31I11NE.tif), and [31I10NO](https://diffusion.mffp.gouv.qc.ca/Diffusion/DonneeGratuite/Foret/IMAGERIE/Produits_derives_LiDAR/31I/31I10NO/MNT_31I10NO.tif), respectively and then move them to their own folder in your directory.**

Set the path to your TIF file directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output_dir <- getwd() # if you want to retrieve the files in your root working directory

output_dir <- "path/to/your/directory/folder" # to specify your directory manually

```

Create a mosaic of the adjacent DTM rasters.

**Note: You should store the DTM's in their own folder after download. The code below will produce an error if there are other .tiff files in your working directory (like the ones you downloaded in Chapter 3).**

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# list all the TIFF files in your directory
dtm_files <- list.files(output_dir, pattern = "\\.tif$", full.names = TRUE) 

# Read into a list of SpatRaster objects
dtm_list <- lapply(dtm_files, rast)

# Combine into a single SpatRaster object
dtm_mosaic <- do.call(mosaic, dtm_list)

# Print information about the stack
print(dtm_mosaic)
```

Let's check if the DTM and National Park boundary have the same crs by using the `st_crs()` function and equality operator (**==**) which will generate either TRUE or FALSE.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
st_crs(dtm_mosaic) == st_crs(mauricie_boundary)
```

To reproject the spatial data with the same CRS, we can use the `st_transform()` function.

```{r}
mauricie_boundary <- st_transform(mauricie_boundary, crs = st_crs(dtm_mosaic))
```

# 4.3 Spatial Extents: Crop & Mask {#4.3Crop-Mask}

**Cropping** reduces the extent of a raster to the extent of another raster or vector.

To crop a raster we can apply the `crop()` function from the `terra` package which uses the SpatVector format. Here, we crop the extent of the raster while converting the National Park Boundary to a SpatVector using `vect()`.

```{r}
dtm_crop <- crop(dtm_mosaic, vect(mauricie_boundary))
```

**Masking** assigns NA values to cells of a raster not covered by a vector.

To mask a raster to a vector extent we can apply the `mask()` function from the `terra` package which also uses the SpatVector format.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
dtm_mask <- mask(dtm_mosaic, vect(mauricie_boundary))
```

OPTIONAL: To write the masked raster to your disk, you can use the `writeRaster()` function from `terra`. **This raster will be used in [Chapter 7: Raster Summary Tools](07-RasterSummaryTools.Rmd)**. We have uploaded this file to the [**Google Drive data folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gLUC6fROl4kNBvTGselhZif-arPexZbY?usp=sharing) for your convenience in the subfolder labeled **mauricie**.

> To execute this code chunk, remove the \#

```{r}
# output_dir <- getwd() ###KLeep this consistent with the above###

# output_dir <- "path/to/your/folder/dtm_mask.tif"  

# writeRaster(dtm_mask, output_dir, overwrite = TRUE) ###Error: [writeRaster] cannot guess file type from filename###
```

# 4.4 Map and Extract Digital Elevation Data {#4.4Map-Extract}

Visualize the regional and masked DTM's with a two-panel plot.

```{r masked_dem, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
# Set up a 1x2 plotting layout
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

# Plot dtm_mosaic
plot(dtm_mosaic, main = "regional DTM")

# Overlay the National Park boundary on the first plot
plot(mauricie_boundary, add = TRUE, border = "red", col = NA, lwd = 2)

# Plot dtm_mask
plot(dtm_mask, main = "masked DTM")

# Overlay the National Park boundary on the second plot
plot(mauricie_boundary, add = TRUE, border = "red", col = NA, lwd = 2)
```

Summarize the NatureCounts data for mapping. Here we will determine the number of species observed at each site.

```{r}
# Group by SiteCode and summarize mean annual count across all species
mauricie_site_summary <- mauricie_birds_sf %>%
  group_by(SiteCode, geometry) %>% 
  summarise(n_species = n_distinct(english_name)) # count the number of unique species
```

Now we can map the NatureCounts summary output with the DTM data.

```{r}
# Match the CRS
mauricie_site_summary <- st_transform(mauricie_site_summary, crs = st_crs(dtm_mask))

# Plot the dtm_mask raster
plot(dtm_mask, main = "Mauricie Mask with Species Diversity Summary Points")

# Overlay the National Park boundary in red
plot(st_geometry(mauricie_boundary), col = NA, border = "red", add = TRUE, lwd = 2)

#scale the n_species column to range from 0-5 for plotting
mauricie_site_summary$n_species_scale <- scales::rescale(mauricie_site_summary$n_species, to = c(0, 2))

# Overlay mauricie_site_summary points
plot(st_geometry(mauricie_site_summary), 
     add = TRUE, 
     pch = 19,       # Solid circle
     col = "blue",   # Point color
     cex = mauricie_site_summary$n_species_scale)      # Point size based on total  ###Can we add a legend of the point size scale###
```

Extract elevation values for each bird observation record and append it to `mauricie_birds`. First, make sure the CRS of both spatial data match and then use `terra::extract()`.

```{r}
# Match the CRS
mauricie_birds_sf <- st_transform(mauricie_birds_sf, crs = st_crs(dtm_mask))

# Extract the elevation values for each site
elevation_values_sf <- terra::extract(dtm_mask, vect(mauricie_birds_sf), bind = TRUE)
```

Convert the sf object holding the extracted elevation values to a dataframe. Use `terra::as.data.frame()` explicitly when calling the function to avoid error.

```{r}
elevation_values_df <- terra::as.data.frame(elevation_values_sf) %>%
  select(record_id, elevation = Band_1)
```

OPTIONAL: To save the elevation data as a *.csv* to your disk, use the `write.csv()` function, specify the name of your .csv file, and use the row.names = FALSE argument to exclude row numbers from the output. **The extracted elevation values will be required to complete [Chapter 7: Summary Tools](07-SummaryTools.Rmd)**. We have uploaded this file to the [**Google Drive data folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gLUC6fROl4kNBvTGselhZif-arPexZbY?usp=sharing) for your convenience.

> To execute this code chunk, remove the \#

```{r}
# write.csv(elevation_values_df, "elevation_values_df.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Now, let's combine the elevation dataframe with the NatureCounts summary data you previously created in order to assess how elevation influences your metric of species diversity.

```{r}
mauricie_site_summary <- st_transform(mauricie_site_summary, crs = st_crs(dtm_mask))

# Extract the elevation values for each site
elevation_sitesum_sf <- terra::extract(dtm_mask, vect(mauricie_site_summary), bind = TRUE)

# Plot the relationship between elevation and species diversity 
plot(elevation_sitesum_sf$Band_1, elevation_sitesum_sf$n_species, 
     xlab = "Elevation (m)", ylab = "Number of Species", 
     main = "Species Diversity vs. Elevation")

```

There does not appear to be a clear relationship between species diversity and elevation in La Mauricie National Park.

Congratulations! You completed **Chapter 4 - Digital Elevation Data**. In this chapter, you successfully 1) processed raster DTM's 2) performed cropping and masking procedures and 3) extracted elevation data over vector data points. In [Chapter 5](05-LandcoverData.Rmd), you will explore how to extract unique pixel values from landcover data and link it to NatureCounts data.

Below are some additional resources you may find useful to further your understanding of LiDAR data.

# 4.5 LiDAR Data Resources {#4.5LiDAR}

[LiDAR](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/sites/nrcan/files/mapstoolspublications/lidar-Nov-2023-EN.pdf) systems help produce extremely accurate measurements of surface elevation to digital terrain and elevation models across landscapes. These systems use instruments (sensors) that are commonly flown on aircraft and incorporate laser ranging for distance, GPS for geographic position and height, and aircraft altitude for the orientation of the instrument. The accuracy of LiDAR measurements depends on the strength of point returns, instrument precision & accuracy, and terrain characteristics, among other factors.

Some notable open LiDAR data resources on the provincial-level include [LidarBC](https://lidar.gov.bc.ca/) - British Columbia and [Forêt ouverte](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/dataset/produits-derives-de-base-du-lidar) - Québec.

The USGS provides LiDAR and its derived products through the [LidarExplorer](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/lidarexplorer) online application. [The National Map](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/national-geospatial-program/national-map) also represents the primary repository for geospatial data in the U.S.

# 4.6 Manual Data Download {#4.6LiDAR}

If you wish to access LiDAR data for La Mauricie National Park yourself to gain experience with the process, follow the steps below. The data are available on the [Forêt ouverte](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/dataset/produits-derives-de-base-du-lidar) platform.

**Step 1**: Navigate to the Lidar data site. Under **Données et ressources** \> **Carte interactive** \> **Forêt ouverte** select (**Explorer \> Accéder**) next to the **Téléchargement** option to explore the Lidar tiles on an interactive map .

```{r image1, echo=FALSE, out.width="700px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/spatdata1.PNG")
```

**Step 2**: Using the search bar, search for **Parc national de la Mauricie**. Under Layers, toggle on **Parc nationaux du Canada** to visualize the park boundary.

```{r image0, echo=FALSE, out.width="700px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/spatdata0.PNG")
```

Alternatively, you can import your own **.shp** or **.kml** file using the **Import and Export** tab.

```{r image2, echo=FALSE, out.width="700px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/spatdata2.PNG")
```

Specify the coordinate reference system (WGS84), click **Import**, and select your **.shp** or **.kml** file to display on the map.

```{r image3, echo=FALSE, out.width="700px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/spatdata3.PNG")
```

**Step 3**: Download the Modèle num. terrain (MNT) (Résolution spatiale 1 m) for each of the six Lidar tiles that intersect with the park (14NE, 15NO, 14SE, 15SO, 11NE, 10NO).

First, navigate to the **Map** tab and toggle on the visibility for the boundary and Lidar MNT layers by clicking on the eye symbol, if necessary. Hovering over this icon will display either the **Show Layer** or **Hide layer** option.

```{r image4, echo=FALSE, out.width="700px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/spatdata4.PNG")
```

Your interactive map should now look something like this:

```{r image5, echo=FALSE, out.width="700px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/spatdata5.PNG")
```

One by one, click and download the terrain data for each of the 6 Lidar tiles that intersect with the park boundary. Click your target tile, expand the **Téléchargement** window and click **Accéder** next to the MNT (1 m spatial resolution) data to download. Repeat for each tile.

```{r image6, echo=FALSE, out.width="700px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/spatdata6.PNG")
```

This will open a webpage directory displaying a list of spatial data files available for the selected tile. Choose the MNT (.tif) file that includes the tile code in its name. For instance, for the first tile covering northern tip of the national park), select "MNT_31I14NE.tif." Repeat this process for each respective tile.

```{r r image10, echo=FALSE, out.width="700px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/spatdata10.PNG")
```

Save these files in your working directory for easy access during this tutorial.

```{r evel=FALSE}
getwd()
```
